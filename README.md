## Introduction 

The Olympic Games is widely recognized as the largest global sporting event, occurring once every four years and spanning approximately two and a half weeks. While the Winter Games also follow a four-year cycle, our focus will solely be on the Summer Olympic Games. Specifically, we will analyze the initial phase of this grand event, namely the first week of the summer edition.

## Improvment of the team in Olympic swimming events
During this period, we will examine the swimming competitions, which are an integral part of the Olympic program. Within swimming, various categories exist, including Butterfly, Freestyle, Backstroke, Breaststroke, and Individual Medley. Our aim is to delve into the historical progression of these swimming events, spanning from 1912 to 2020. By exploring this extensive timeline, we hope to uncover any advancements or improvements within each category over the years.

## Distribution of medals over the years
We would like to explore our next question, which is to determine the number of teams/countries that have participated in the swimming events of the Olympic Games over the years. We are interested in understanding whether there has been a change in the number of teams since the inaugural Olympic Games held in Stockholm in 1912.

Looking at the chart provided, we observe a significant increase in the number of teams participating in swimming events from 1964 to 2020.

## Number of medals for a specific team
In our upcoming chart analysis, we aim to determine the distribution of medals awarded to each team throughout the Olympic Games from 1912 to 2020. Additionally, we plan to incorporate a vertical line that represents the average number of medals awarded in the swimming events for each individual Olympic Games. To accomplish this, I have created an animated chart that focuses on seven specific teams: United States, Australia, Canada, United Kingdom, Germany, Hungary, and Japan.
