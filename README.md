The Olympic Games is widely recognized as the largest global sporting event, occurring once every four years and spanning approximately two and a half weeks. While the Winter Games also follow a four-year cycle, our focus will solely be on the Summer Olympic Games. Specifically, we will analyze the initial phase of this grand event, namely the first week of the summer edition.

During this period, we will examine the swimming competitions, which are an integral part of the Olympic program. Within swimming, various categories exist, including Butterfly, Freestyle, Backstroke, Breaststroke, and Individual Medley. Our aim is to delve into the historical progression of these swimming events, spanning from 1912 to 2020. By exploring this extensive timeline, we hope to uncover any advancements or improvements within each category over the years.
