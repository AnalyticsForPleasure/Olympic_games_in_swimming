## Introduction 

The Olympic Games is widely recognized as the largest global sporting event, occurring once every four years and spanning approximately two and a half weeks. While the Winter Games also follow a four-year cycle, our focus will solely be on the Summer Olympic Games. Specifically, we will analyze the initial phase of this grand event, namely the first week of the summer edition.

## Improvment of the team in Olympic swimming events
During this period, we will examine the swimming competitions, which are an integral part of the Olympic program. Within swimming, various categories exist, including Butterfly, Freestyle, Backstroke, Breaststroke, and Individual Medley. Our aim is to delve into the historical progression of these swimming events, spanning from 1912 to 2020. By exploring this extensive timeline, we hope to uncover any advancements or improvements within each category over the years.

## Distribution of medals over the years
We would like to explore our next question, which is to determine the number of teams/countries that have participated in the swimming events of the Olympic Games over the years. We are interested in understanding whether there has been a change in the number of teams since the inaugural Olympic Games held in Stockholm in 1912.

Looking at the chart provided, we observe a significant increase in the number of teams participating in swimming events from 1964 to 2020.

## Number of medals for a specific team
In our upcoming chart analysis, we aim to determine the distribution of medals awarded to each team throughout the Olympic Games from 1912 to 2020. Additionally, we plan to incorporate a vertical line that represents the average number of medals awarded in the swimming events for each individual Olympic Games. To accomplish this, I have created an animated chart that focuses on seven specific teams: United States, Australia, Canada, United Kingdom, Germany, Hungary, and Japan.

## How home field advantage gives Olympic host countries an Edge?

In our upcoming analysis, we aim to investigate whether there is any correlation between teams that had the advantage of competing on their home turf during the Olympic games. Specifically, we want to explore whether a connection exists between countries that hosted the Olympic games and the number of medals their national teams won in swimming events.

To accomplish this, I have chosen to examine the medal counts before and after each country hosted the games, comparing the results from four years prior to the games to the results during the Olympic games they hosted. For instance, we will examine the case of Sydney, Australia, hosting the games in 2000. We will assess whether there was an increase or decrease in the number of medals won by the Australian swimming team during the 2000 Olympics compared to four years before that event. This analysis will help us better understand any potential influence of hosting the games on a country's swimming team performance.

## Which swimmers hold the highest number of Olympic records?

The most thrilling elements of the Olympic games are undoubtedly the World Records (WR) and Olympic Records (OR). Consequently, we are eager to examine the statistics of elite athletes who have attained the prestigious title of an Olympic Record holder in swimming throughout the years. Our goal is to identify the most decorated swimmers who have repeatedly broken Olympic Records during various Olympic games. 

**Are there any swimmers who have achieved this remarkable feat multiple times over the years?**

We aim to uncover and celebrate these exceptional athletes and their extraordinary achievements in the realm of Olympic swimming.
